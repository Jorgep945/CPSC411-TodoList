# CPSC411-TodoList
My code or the first project of the class.

I don't have screenshots as I couldn't find a way to make this work in time, but I had done enough of my own work and research to create at the minimum something that shows an attempt to create the To-Do List. This includes creating data classes to hold number and string values and have the functions called in, as well as importing the appropriate librarys necessary. I created the outliine for the rows that should lead down and be checked off, as well as the inputs for creating specific goals, list them as items, and be able to switch between them. The biggest issue I had with it was the unresolved UI and Reference for SimpleToDOListTheme. Fixing those should have been able to get me to see the result but I couldn't do it.
